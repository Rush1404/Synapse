    "inp": "As I sit here alone, the weight of sorrow hangs heavy in the air. The echoes of lost dreams and broken promises fill the silence, and the tears that escape my eyes tell a story of pain that words cannot express. In this lonely moment, it feels as if the world has turned its back, and the ache in my heart seems insurmountable."
